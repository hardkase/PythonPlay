Learning Python;
Hello.py: ubiquitous "hello world" - done as a test after successfully setting up environment after win10 issues with path;
Roll.py: this is a dice roller for something like an RPG, with a menu allowing die selection, including d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100, and a D&D attribute roller summing 3 rolls d6. Next step to use a collection to record d rolling history (will need to include which die was rolled, so probably use sets or dict), pay.py is a cashier app - input price and payment, return cash. Roman returns a roman numeral for a decimal input. Sudoku validates a set of 81 ints to see if they work as a sudoku puzzle - this is a brute force approach and it works. Numcrunch generates strings of random 1-9 ints for sudoku and sudoku imports it as a module.
