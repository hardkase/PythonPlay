Hello - ubiquitous "hello world" - done as a test after successfully setting up environment after win10 issues with path
Roll - this is a dice roller for something like an RPG, with a menu allowing die selection, including d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100, and a D&D attribute roller summing 3 rolls d6. Next step to use a collection to record d rolling history (will need to include which die was rolled, so probably use sets or dict)
